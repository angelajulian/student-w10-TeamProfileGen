# Installation

If you would like to use this project:

1. clone from github
2. install npm to your machine if you have not already.
3. in the home directory, run `npm install`
4. after installation of all dependencies is complete, run `node index.js`

- Dependencies: jest, inquirer

# Usage

- From the root of the directory type "npm start" to start the server
- Inquirer will begin to ask a list of questions.
- It may be best to fill out all managers, first!
- continue through the prompts until you are finished, then select "I'm done."
- /dist/index.html will contain the HTML team page generated based off of your answers.

NOTE: running the program a second time will destroy your current team page!
